### Description
- When you place a filter inserter, it reads either the inventory contents or inventory filters on the pickup side and sets its filter to those items.
- Fills the inserter's filter only until it is full (of course).
- Sets the inserter's filter only if there is no filter already set (for example from a replaced preconfigured ghost).
- The mode can be changed or disabled in player mod settings on the fly as needed.
- Should work with most modded filter inserters.
