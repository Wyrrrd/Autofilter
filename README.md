### Features
When you manually place a filter inserter, it reads either the inventory contents or inventory filters on the pickup side and sets its filter to those items. The mode can be changed or disabled in player mod settings on the fly as needed.

### Compatibility
This mod should work with all modded filter inserters, but I specifically added compatibility for the following mods:

+ [Bob's Adjustable Inserters](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/bobinserters) - rotated pickup positions
+ [Informatron](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/informatron) - informational page to explain modes
+ [Factorio Wiki Mod](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/wiki) - informational topic to explain modes
+ [Booktorio](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Booktorio) - informational thread to explain modes
