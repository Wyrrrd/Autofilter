# Autofilter
![mod thumbnail](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Wyrrrd/Autofilter/master/thumbnail.png)

Description:
- When you place a filter inserter, it reads either the inventory contents or inventory filters on the pickup side and sets it's filter to those items.
- Fills the inserter's filter only until it is full (of course).
- The mode can be changed or disabled in player mod settings on the fly as needed.
- Should work with most modded filter inserters.

Notes:
- Currently does not work if a mod moves the pickup location directly after placing the inserter (for example [Bob's Logistics](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/boblogistics)).
- Filter gets overwritten when the player places a filtered inserter on a ghost that already has a filter configured. Does not overwrite when placed with bots.
