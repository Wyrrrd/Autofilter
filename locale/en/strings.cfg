[tips-and-tricks-item-description]
autofilter=When you manually place a [entity=inserter] (and if automatic filters are enabled in settings), it reads the inventory contents, inventory filters or belt contents on the pickup side and sets its filter to those items.\n\nThere is only one text field to enter configuration of this behaviour into. This can be done on the fly, while ingame. You can add each of the following keywords into the text field, in any order, separated by spaces. They will be processed left to right.\n\n - contents : Checks for filter candidates in the inventory contents at the pickup position of the [entity=inserter].\n - filter : Checks for filter candidates in the inventory's filter settings at the pickup position of the [entity=inserter].\n - belt : Checks for filter candidates in the items on a [entity=transport-belt] or [entity=splitter] at the pickup position of the [entity=inserter].\n - check : Checks for the current filter candidates, if they could be inserted in the inventory at the drop position of the [entity=inserter] and removes them from the candidate list, if unsuccessful.\n - Anything else gets ignored. If you want to disable all functionality of Autofilter, just write anything into the text field.\n\nAfter those are processed, a deduplication removes all but the first appearance of each item from the filter candidate list, and then the candidates are written to the filter of the [entity=inserter] until it is full.
